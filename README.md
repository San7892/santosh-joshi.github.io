program 1:
## Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
Executes the specified operation and returns the result.

program2:
# The nth odd positive integer is given by the formula: 2*n + 1
        # Since 'i' starts at 0 (for the 1st number), the formula is: 2*i + 1

program3:
# 1. Determine the number of terms (N) to generate.
# 2. Generate the first N odd positive integers (1, 3, 5, ...).
 # The nth odd positive integer is given by the formula: 2*n + 1
    # Since range starts at 0, we iterate from i = 0 up to num_of_terms - 1.


program 4: 
# Define the divisors we are checking against
    
    # Use a dictionary to store the results
   
    # Iterate through each divisor
    
        # Check every number in the input list
        for num in data_list:
            # If the number is a multiple of the divisor (remainder is 0)
